title: Sharing Beauty and Finding Gratitude

They say beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Depending on the subject or topic, there, of course, is some objectivity to beauty, --but as a whole, everybody experiences beauty in their own way. 

My goal with this project you?re reading, (and some of my other projects in general), is to capture the things that I find beautiful and share them. In the past, I've done collections of different experiences, settings, or art pieces, and that's generally pretty easy to share through a visual media. 

What's harder, I think, is to share what I find beautiful through text, through my thoughts, and through sharing my experiences or worldview with you?not just specific juxtapositions or scenery, but processes and phenomena I want to highlight. I know I'm speaking with a broad brush, but hopefully, with future posts, I'll be able to hone my writing a little bit more and you?ll be able to understand.

Something that I personally try to incorporate more into my life is gratitude. You can do that in many different ways, but one of them is finding the beauty in the everyday: while walking down the street, while listening to a friend talk about something they're passionate about. 

It's very easy to live your life on autopilot?not only is it easy, but it's natural to overlook things you see often. It takes extra effort to turn your brain on, to turn off the autopilot, and to look for things to appreciate. I don't know about you, but for me, I naturally look for ways to make things more efficient. Gratitude, however, is inherently inefficient; it's taking time to smell the roses and to appreciate something you find beautiful. So hopefully, as you read through other entries, I will be able to share ideas and thoughts --and perhaps you, too, will appreciate them.
